#Digital Image Correlation (DIC) adapted for damage and crack mechanics

Stereo System: It is a dual webcam system where both the cameras are considered as a single measurement system. This system is constructed to determine the relative orientation
and position of an arbitrarily selected camera with respect to the remaining camera.

Experimental setup for stereo system calibration:\
Step 1: We need two webcams (1080 p). Connect them to a laptop where the working code "Dual WebCam Setup using OpenCV" will be executed.\
Step 2: Make sure the webcams are attachned to a fixed support (in our case we have used two tripods).\
